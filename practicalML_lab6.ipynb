    "[Exploratory data analysis](https://www.ibm.com/topics/exploratory-data-analysis) (EDA) is an important part of data analytics and data science. It is consider an axiomatic step in machine learning experimentation. In essence, it is the insights from your EDA, that decides all later choices regarding feature selection, data mining, learning algorithm selection, evaluation etc. However, the process of EDA can also be very time-consuming and repetitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be awesome if we could automate parts of it? This is where [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) (`formerly, pandas-profiling`) comes in. The primary goal of ydata-profiling is to provide a one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution. Like pandas' `df.describe()` function, that is so handy, ydata-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while allowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as html and json."
